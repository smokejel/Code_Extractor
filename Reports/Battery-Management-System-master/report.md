## Functional Requirements

* **FR1 - Battery Parameter Initialization:** The system shall initialize the battery management system (BMS) parameters, including temperature limits, overcurrent protection thresholds, undervoltage and overvoltage protection thresholds, and balancing thresholds.
* **FR2 - Data Acquisition:** The system shall continuously measure the battery's voltage and current.
* **FR3 - State of Charge (SOC) Calculation:** The system shall calculate the SOC based on current readings and voltage changes over time, expressing it as a percentage of the total battery capacity.
* **FR4 - State of Health (SOH) Calculation:** The system shall calculate the SOH based on the measured internal resistance of the battery, relative to a reference resistance value.
* **FR5 - Data Storage:** The system shall store the calculated SOC, SOH, and Depth of Discharge (DOD) values in non-volatile memory (EEPROM).
* **FR6 - Overcurrent Protection:** The system shall trigger an interrupt and implement a delay when an overcurrent condition is detected.  The system shall count the number of overcurrent events.
* **FR7 - Capacity Adjustment:** The system shall adjust the assumed battery capacity based on the calculated SOH.
* **FR8 - Battery Balancing:** The system shall enable automatic cell balancing.
* **FR9 - Discharging Control:** The system shall enable and control the discharging process of the battery.

## Non-Functional Requirements

* **NFR1 - Real-time Performance:** The system shall update the SOC and SOH calculations at a frequency sufficient to reflect real-time changes in battery conditions. (Target: At least every 20ms as suggested by the `BMS.update()` comment).
* **NFR2 - Accuracy:** The SOC and SOH calculations shall be within an acceptable tolerance range. (Specific tolerance needs further definition).
* **NFR3 - Safety:** The overcurrent protection mechanism shall respond within a specified timeframe to prevent damage to the battery. (Specific timeframe needs to be defined).
* **NFR4 - Data Integrity:** The stored SOC, SOH, and DOD values shall be protected against data corruption.
* **NFR5 - Power Consumption:** The system shall minimize power consumption to extend battery life.


## Additional Notes and Open Issues:

* **Tolerance Ranges:**  Specific tolerance ranges for accuracy (NFR2) are required.
* **Overcurrent Response Time:** The maximum allowable response time for overcurrent protection (NFR3) needs to be specified.
* **Hardware Dependencies:**  The requirements assume specific hardware components (e.g., bq769x0 BMS chip, specific microcontroller with EEPROM). These dependencies should be explicitly documented.
* **Interrupt Handling:**  The handling of multiple interrupts (c[0] to c[3]) in the `setup` function suggests multiple overcurrent triggers. The exact behavior and interaction of these interrupts needs clarification.  The consequence of reaching 5 overcurrent events (k<=5) needs clarification.
* **Units:** The units of measurement for various parameters (current, voltage, resistance, etc.) should be explicitly stated in the requirements.
