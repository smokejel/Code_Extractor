The data flow in the provided C code can be described as follows:

1. **Global Variable Initialization**:
   - The code defines several global variables and constants that are crucial for the Battery Management System (BMS). 
   - These include variables for current (`Current`), voltage (`Voltage`), and others like `SOC` (State of Charge), `SOH` (State of Health), and `Q` (total charge).

2. **BatteryManagement Function**:
   - This function initializes the BMS parameters using the `bq769x0` library. 
   - It sets various protection limits (temperature, overcurrent, undervoltage, etc.) and enables features like auto-balancing and discharging. 
   - This function sets up the BMS, but does not produce direct data output; it configures the state of the system.

3. **Setup Function**:
   - The `setup` function configures the input pins for current and voltage and retrieves the previously stored discharge data from EEPROM.
   - It establishes interrupts for overcurrent conditions, linking to the `overcurrent` function, which could stop the system during fault conditions.

4. **Loop Function**:
   - The main loop calls `SOC_Calc` and `SOH_Calc` functions repeatedly, enabling continuous monitoring and updating of the battery's state.

5. **SOC_Calc Function**:
   - This function calculates the State of Charge (SOC) based on current readings and the voltage difference over time.
   - It reads the voltage and current at intervals, updating `Q` (total charge) based on the current readings and calculating SOC as a percentage of the total capacity. 

6. **SOH_Calc Function**:
   - This function computes the State of Health (SOH) of the battery by measuring the internal resistance during charge cycles.
   - It reads the voltage and current, calculates the resistance `R`, and updates the SOH based on the ratio of the measured resistance to a predefined reference `Ro`.
   - It writes the calculated SOC, SOH, and DOD (Depth of Discharge) values to EEPROM for persistent storage.

7. **Overcurrent Function**:
   - This function is triggered by interrupts and delays the system for a specified time when an overcurrent condition is detected.
   - It increments a counter `k` and can be used to implement protective measures against overcurrent situations.

Overall, the data flow in the code is structured around constant updates of battery parameters (SOC and SOH) based on real-time current and voltage measurements, with provisions for safety via interrupts and EEPROM storage for critical values. The functions interdependently manage and maintain the integrity of the battery management system, ensuring that the system responds to changing conditions while keeping track of its state over time.
