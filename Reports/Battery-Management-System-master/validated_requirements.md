## Validated Requirement Statements

### Functional Requirements

1. **FR1 - Battery Parameter Initialization:** The system shall initialize the battery management system (BMS) parameters, including temperature limits, overcurrent protection thresholds, undervoltage and overvoltage protection thresholds, and balancing thresholds.
2. **FR2 - Data Acquisition:** The system shall continuously measure the battery's voltage and current.
3. **FR3 - State of Charge (SOC) Calculation:** The system shall calculate the SOC based on current readings and voltage changes over time, expressing it as a percentage of the total battery capacity.
4. **FR4 - State of Health (SOH) Calculation:** The system shall calculate the SOH based on the measured internal resistance of the battery, relative to a reference resistance value.
5. **FR5 - Data Storage:** The system shall store the calculated SOC, SOH, and Depth of Discharge (DOD) values in non-volatile memory (EEPROM).
6. **FR6 - Overcurrent Protection:** The system shall trigger an interrupt and implement a delay when an overcurrent condition is detected. The system shall count the number of overcurrent events.
7. **FR7 - Capacity Adjustment:** The system shall adjust the assumed battery capacity based on the calculated SOH.
8. **FR8 - Battery Balancing:** The system shall enable automatic cell balancing.
9. **FR9 - Discharging Control:** The system shall enable and control the discharging process of the battery.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **NFR1 - Real-time Performance:** The system shall update the SOC and SOH calculations at a frequency sufficient to reflect real-time changes in battery conditions. (Target: At least every 20ms as suggested by the `BMS.update()` comment).
2. **NFR2 - Accuracy:** The SOC and SOH calculations shall be within an acceptable tolerance range. (Specific tolerance needs further definition).
3. **NFR3 - Safety:** The overcurrent protection mechanism shall respond within a specified timeframe to prevent damage to the battery. (Specific timeframe needs to be defined).
4. **NFR4 - Data Integrity:** The stored SOC, SOH, and DOD values shall be protected against data corruption.
5. **NFR5 - Power Consumption:** The system shall minimize power consumption to extend battery life.

### Additional Notes and Open Issues

1. **Tolerance Ranges:** Specific tolerance ranges for accuracy (NFR2) are required.
2. **Overcurrent Response Time:** The maximum allowable response time for overcurrent protection (NFR3) needs to be specified.
3. **Hardware Dependencies:** The requirements assume specific hardware components (e.g., bq769x0 BMS chip, specific microcontroller with EEPROM). These dependencies should be explicitly documented.
4. **Interrupt Handling:** The handling of multiple interrupts (c[0] to c[3]) in the `setup` function suggests multiple overcurrent triggers. The exact behavior and interaction of these interrupts needs clarification. The consequence of reaching 5 overcurrent events (k<=5) needs clarification.
5. **Units:** The units of measurement for various parameters (current, voltage, resistance, etc.) should be explicitly stated in the requirements. 

These validated requirement statements contain the expectations for the battery management system, but further review of the actual code is necessary to confirm their implementation.
