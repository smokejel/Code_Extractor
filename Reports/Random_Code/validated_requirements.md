1. **Functional Requirements:**
   - **FR1**: The system allows users to input an integer value for an array size (covered by files 2, 3, 4).
   - **FR2**: The system allocates memory dynamically for an integer array based on the user input size using `malloc`, `calloc`, or `realloc` (covered by all files).
   - **FR3**: The system allows users to input integer values into the dynamically allocated array (covered by files 2, 3, 4).
   - **FR4**: The system displays the values stored in the array after user input (covered by all files).
   - **FR5**: The system reallocates memory for the array when the user specifies a new size, ensuring that previous data is retained (covered by files 4, 5, and 6).
   - **FR6**: The system initializes array elements with a specific pattern (e.g., multiples of 7) upon allocation or reallocation (covered by files 5 and 6).

2. **Non-Functional Requirements:**
   - **NFR1**: The system ensures that all dynamically allocated memory is properly freed before the program ends to prevent memory leaks (not explicitly covered in the provided code, but should be implemented).
   - **NFR2**: The system provides feedback to the user for successful memory allocation or any errors encountered during memory allocation (not explicitly covered in the provided code, but should be implemented).
   - **NFR3**: The system operates with a response time of less than 2 seconds for array size inputs and data display (not testable from the code directly).
   - **NFR4**: The system maintains data integrity by ensuring valid inputs are collected from the user, and it handles invalid inputs gracefully (not explicitly covered in the provided code).
   - **NFR5**: The system conforms to C programming standards and best practices for memory management (generally followed, but specific checks for standards are not present).

This validation shows the requirement statements are generally aligned with the functionalities present in the C code, albeit with some non-functional requirements that need further implementation or testing.
