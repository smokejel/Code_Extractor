1. **Functional Requirements:**
   - **FR1**: The system shall allow users to input an integer value for an array size.
   - **FR2**: The system shall allocate memory dynamically for an integer array based on the user input size using `malloc`, `calloc`, or `realloc`.
   - **FR3**: The system shall allow users to input integer values into the dynamically allocated array.
   - **FR4**: The system shall display the values stored in the array after user input.
   - **FR5**: The system shall reallocate memory for the array when the user specifies a new size, ensuring that previous data is retained.
   - **FR6**: The system shall initialize array elements with a specific pattern (e.g., multiples of 7) upon allocation or reallocation.

2. **Non-Functional Requirements:**
   - **NFR1**: The system shall ensure that all dynamically allocated memory is properly freed before the program ends to prevent memory leaks.
   - **NFR2**: The system shall provide feedback to the user for successful memory allocation or any errors encountered during memory allocation.
   - **NFR3**: The system shall operate with a response time of less than 2 seconds for array size inputs and data display.
   - **NFR4**: The system shall maintain data integrity by ensuring valid inputs are collected from the user, and it shall handle invalid inputs gracefully.
   - **NFR5**: The system shall conform to C programming standards and best practices for memory management.
