The data flow in this C code involves multiple paths and dependencies, primarily centered around player state management, board display, and event handling. The player's position and score are updated based on interactions defined through various functions, each serving a specific role in the game mechanics. The core functions for player actions and board display interact closely, ensuring that data is correctly processed and presented based on user input and game rules. The use of random number generation adds an element of unpredictability, influencing prize acquisition and player movement, which is essential for the game's flow. Overall, the code demonstrates a clear structure in how data is initialized, transformed, and utilized throughout the game's lifecycle.
