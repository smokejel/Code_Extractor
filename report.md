### Requirement Statements for Board Game C Code

#### Functional Requirements

1. **FR-01**: The system shall initialize the player's score, prizes, and position upon invoking the `initPlayer()` function.
2. **FR-02**: The system shall allow the player to roll a specified number of dice using the `playerRoll()` function and return the total rolled value.
3. **FR-03**: The system shall display the current state of the game board, including the playerâ€™s position and prizes, through the `displayBoard()` function.
4. **FR-04**: The system shall award a regular prize when the player lands on a winning space ('W'), by invoking the `winPrize()` function.
5. **FR-05**: The system shall award a grand prize when the player lands on a grand prize space ('G'), by invoking the `winGrandPrize()` function.
6. **FR-06**: The system shall allow the player to lose a prize when landing on a losing space ('L') by invoking the `loseItem()` function.
7. **FR-07**: The system shall allow the player to convert their collected prizes into a score via the `checkout()` function, ending the game if the score reaches 200 or above.
8. **FR-08**: The system shall validate user input using the `getValidCharacter()` and `getValidInteger()` functions before proceeding with any actions.
9. **FR-09**: The system shall update the player's inventory and reflect changes in the game state whenever an item is dropped.

#### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **NFR-01**: The system shall display updates to the game board within 2 seconds of player input to ensure a responsive user experience.
2. **NFR-02**: The system shall maintain data integrity by ensuring that the player's score and inventory are accurately updated after each action.
3. **NFR-03**: The system shall be compatible with standard C compilers to facilitate ease of implementation across various platforms.
4. **NFR-04**: The system shall ensure that the maximum number of items in a room does not exceed defined limits, failing gracefully if the limit is reached.
5. **NFR-05**: The system shall use clear and understandable messages for all user interactions to enhance user experience and reduce confusion.

#### Additional Requirements

1. **AR-01**: All requirement statements shall be traceable with a unique identifier to facilitate future updates and maintenance.
2. **AR-02**: The requirements document shall be organized into a hierarchical structure to promote clarity and ease of navigation for stakeholders.
3. **AR-03**: The requirements shall be vetted by a diverse team of stakeholders, including developers, testers, and end-users, to ensure completeness and usability.

These requirements aim to provide a comprehensive framework for the development and testing of the board game C code, ensuring clear expectations for functionality and system performance.
